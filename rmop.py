rmop.py - emulation of the NCEP "Relative Measure of Predictability" (RMOP)
          product, computed from the NCEP hybrid ensemble HGEFS (31 GEFS + 31 AIGEFS
          members pooled; --source gefs falls back to GEFS alone).

WHAT RMOP IS
------------
RMOP was developed at NCEP/EMC (Z. Toth, Y. Zhu, T. Marchok) and was widely
used by forecasters at CPC/HPC/WFOs.  For 500 hPa height it answers "is this
ensemble forecast more or less predictable than usual?" using only the
agreement among ensemble members, normalised for location, season, lead time
and the position of the forecast within the climate distribution.

ALGORITHM (as documented in the literature - see REFERENCES)
------------------------------------------------------------
 1. CLIMATE BINS.  At every grid point and for every calendar month, split the
    reanalysis climatology of Z500 into 10 equally likely bins (deciles).
    Bin edges are linearly interpolated in time between months.     [T01 s5]
 2. ENSEMBLE-MEAN BIN.  Find the climate bin that contains the ensemble mean.
 3. SUPPORTING MEMBERS.  Count how many individual members fall in that same
    bin.  Few => low predictability, many => high predictability.   [T01 s5]
    Because the bins are climatologically equiprobable they are wide in the
    tails and narrow near the median, so the count is comparable regardless of
    where in the climate distribution the forecast sits.
 4. RELATIVE (PERCENTILE) SCALE.  The count is converted to a percentile of the
    distribution of counts from the PREVIOUS 30 DAYS of forecasts at the same
    lead time.  "Shading at 90% means at least 9 of 10 ensemble forecasts in
    the past 30 days had fewer members in the ensemble-mean bin than the
    present forecast."                                              [EMC GEFS page]
    The 2001 paper pooled the distribution over the NH extratropics and
    optionally weighted days with a recursive filter (0.97 old / 0.03 new).
 5. DISPLAY.  Shade the 0-100 percentile in 10% steps (blue = least predictable
    10% ... orange = most predictable 10%), contour the ensemble-mean Z500.
    The default output re-creates the original GrADS graphic: Hershey Roman Simplex
    text, 2 px contours with horizontal labels in white boxes, a dotted grid, the
    triangle-ended colour bar and the original 14-colour palette.  It is written as
    a 300 DPI PNG at 5x the original resolution (3475 x 2725 px = the 11 x 8.5 in
    page at print size); --scale 1 --out x.gif gives the original 695 x 545 GIF87a.
    --style mpl gives a smooth matplotlib version with the same layout.
 6. VERIFICATION NUMBERS.  For past forecasts that can already be verified,
    compute how often the verifying analysis fell in the same climate bin as
    the ensemble mean, stratified by predictability class (the "blue numbers"
    printed on the original graphic).

WHAT IS AN APPROXIMATION HERE (the original code is not public)
---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Members: --source hgefs pools the 31 GEFS members with the 31 AIGEFS members
   (AI-based, GraphCast-derived, 0.25 deg, 6-hourly) after thinning AIGEFS to the GEFS
   0.5 deg grid; every member counts equally and the verifying analysis is the GEFS control.
 * Original: 10 (later 20/21) members, 2.5 deg grid, 1x1 reanalysis deciles.
   Here: GEFS (control + 30 perturbed members by default), on the native 0.5 deg
   grid.  0.5 deg is the finest PUBLIC GEFS grid that carries 500 hPa height: the
   0.25 deg GEFS product ("pgrb2s", NCO inventory gec00.t00z.pgrb2s.0p25) is a
   select-parameters file of surface/near-surface fields only (2 m T, 10 m wind,
   CAPE, ...) with no pressure-level heights, and the model's own ~25 km cubed-sphere
   grid is not distributed for pressure levels.  --stride 5 thins to the original 2.5 deg.
 * Tie handling for the percentile is not documented.  The count is a whole
   number, and at short leads a large share of points have EVERY member in the
   mean's bin, so those points all tie.  Default here (--ties spread): each count
   keeps the percentile range the history gives it, but the tied points are spread
   across that range ordered by normalised ensemble spread (tighter = higher), so
   the colours use the full 0-100 scale as the EMC FAQ says they should.  This is
   my own addition.  --ties mid puts all tied points at the middle of the range
   (flat colour blocks at short leads); --ties strict is the literal EMC wording
   (fraction of history with strictly fewer members).
 * The "Probability" row follows the paper: observed hit frequency for each bin
   count, averaged over the points of the current map that make up each colour.
 * Climatology: default recipe builds monthly deciles from NCEP/NCAR
   Reanalysis-1 daily Z500, 1991-2020 (the 2001 paper used the NCEP
   reanalysis, Kalnay et al. 1996).  Any NetCDF with daily Z500 works.
 * Whether the 30-day distribution is pooled over the domain or kept per grid
   point is ambiguous in the text.  Default: pooled over the domain (as in the
   paper); --pool point gives a per-grid-point history.

# ======================================================================
# 6b. Pixel-level GrADS-style renderer (default)
# ======================================================================
# The reference RMOP graphics were made with GrADS: a 695 x 545 non-antialiased GIF
# using GrADS's default stroke font (Hershey Roman Simplex), libgd thick lines, a
# 14-entry palette, a dotted grid and a fixed colour-bar graphic.  Everything below
# was measured from, and fitted to, the pixels of a real product (init 2001061200,
# f168): text is Hershey Roman Simplex at 2-3 px stroke thickness (fits within 1 px
# on 98-100 % of the text pixels), lines use libgd's gdImageLine thick-line algorithm,
# and the static pieces (dot pattern, colour-bar graphic) are reproduced exactly.
#
# scale = 1 reproduces the original 695 x 545 pixels.  scale = S > 1 is a true
# re-render at S times the resolution (same layout, strokes S times as thick, smooth
# diagonals and class boundaries), NOT a pixel enlargement.  The original page is
# 11 x 8.5 in at ~63 px/in, so scale 5 at 300 DPI is the page at print size.
#
# The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr. A. V. Hershey while working at the
# U. S. National Bureau of Standards.  The format of the Font data in this distribution
# was originally created by James Hurt, Cognition, Inc., 900 Technology Park Drive,
# Billerica, MA 01821.  (Public-domain distribution; glyph data embedded below.)
